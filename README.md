How we translate freight
One page repository for commonly used freight terms
A simple searchable online tool to allow the world to search for commonly used freight terminology
Each freight term on the site will have a versioned description (think urban dictonary)
It is opensource and users can add their comments, terms and descriptions once approved by our admin
Admin will be manually managed via email admin teamfreightwiki@gmail.com
Each heading will have max 3 descriptions intially, most relevant decided by the admin team
Open source is the goal. The aim is to remove some of the confusion and open the doors to our industry.
